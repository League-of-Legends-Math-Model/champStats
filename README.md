# champStats
A compilation of various league projects.

Created by Jon-Michael Rutter and Max Highsmith.  Our first project was to create an optimization model for Caitlyn as part of a Mathematical Modeling class.  This expanded into bigger ideas, including Calculated (the java and some of the python in this repository--a program that provides you with information on the abilities of your opponents' characters in a match), and Sun Tzu (tentatively named because of the axiom of "Know Your Enemy"--a project that looks at one's opponents' past performance and tries to convey how skilled an opponent is).
The java code in this repository is Jon-Michael's.  All Python code is prefaced with the author's name (JK Rutter & Jon-Michael are both Jon-Michael).
